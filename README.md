# passwordGenerator
A password generator created in Python. Uses a GUI
Used tkinter to create a GUI that allows the user to choose whether the password should include uppercase letters, 
numbers and symbols. It also allows the user to choose the length (between 1 and 60).
Once the password has been generated, the user can view it in the GUI and copy to clipboard to save it somewhere.
This project will be part of my development of a password manager that will be able to store generated passwords,
in a cryptographically secure way.
